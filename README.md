This is a massive project with active development in progress and this repo will be updated in time, be warned, things can break and always always backup backup backup!

Kronos is a Dashboard Interface and Wallet for Denarius (D), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), BitClout (CLOUT) and Fantom Opera (FTM) as an app written in NodeJS and Electron. The Kronos Wallet is also now available on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. (You can also access it on mobile from your local network).

Send and Receive D, BTC, ETH, USDT, BSC, BUSD, CLOUT, and FTM Funds in Core Mode!

In Advanced Mode create new Denarius addresses, view transactions, unlock/lock wallet, stake D, reboot your node, import private keys, encrypt your wallet, broadcast raw transactions, sign and verify Denarius messages, and much more!

This was built for the Raspberry Pi in mind and one with at least 2GB of RAM. 4GB and 8GB models are recommended! Kronos will run on any Linux distro with a minimal amount of 2GB of RAM.

Running the Kronos headless installer script below installs denarius via snap install and then modifies your .env in Kronos and denarius.conf to a random rpcuser and rpcpass, Kronos will then be running on your LAN (192.168.x.x:3000) on port 3000.
